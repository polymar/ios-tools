This folder contains source Xcode template (not usable in its bare state) and a ruby script for converting the source Xcode template into a usabe Xcode template.

In order to generate a project Xcode template, use the following script:

ruby gen_template.rb Owner Author

   - Owner represents the owner of the project and the copyright holder
   - Author represents who is creating/writing the project

The script will generate a new folder called 'owner'_template, which can be installed as Xcode template
copying it at '~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/' (Note: you might have to create the 'Templates' folder).
